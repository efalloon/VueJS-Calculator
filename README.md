# VueJS-Calculator üßÆ
This is a calculator built in VueJS that can utilises Javascript, HTML and CSS. The calculator is small as to allow it to be used later as a modal popup for websites. It also includes keyboard commands for shortcuts and a history panel so that you can revisit equations.

Additional implementations for the future could include...
 - a delete button (backspace)
 - copy and paste equations
 - more significant equations (eg *x10^ùë•*)
